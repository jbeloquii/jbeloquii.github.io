# Command-Line tools for Linguists wrap-up

## Introduction

The **Command-Line Tools** course teaches future linguists basic tools for programming on Linux, it can be a useful subject as new technologies have a huge influence on linguistics. During this subject, we had to work on 7 quizzes divided into 7 weeks, where we had to watch multiple videos and follow reading tutorials in order to be able to complete the quizzes. Each week we learning a new tool which we would end up using on our final project.

### Week 1

In _week 1_, we started learning the basic commands of _Linux_, such as **cat, mv, cp, mkdir, wget, echo, touch** and **nano**. These which will be major commands and will be very frequently used in the upcoming weeks.

For example _"cp file1 file2"_ is used to rename a file.

### Week 2

In _week 2_, we continued learning essential commands such a **man**, **chmod** to give permissions, **sort**, we learned how to access different directories through **cd**, we started learning about _paths_, we learned about **killall**, and we kept learning more about **nano** and **wget**. It is great that we kept learning about these commands as they have become automatic during this final assignment.

This week we learned the command of _"chmod 755"_ which is very useful when getting a lor of errors. 

### Week 3

In _week 3_, we focused greatly in _UTF-8_, we also started learning using **egrep** and **wc** which are specially useful for linguistics and book analysis.

The command _"tail -n +1000 book.txt"_ skips the first 999 words of a text file which is useful for literature analysis.

### Week 4

In _week 4_, we learned about the **sed** command which allows to modify text, and we learned about frequency lists using **cat, tr**, and **egrep**.

### Week 5

In _week 5_, we discovered _scripts_, which in my opinion are very hard to learn at the beginning, but end up being very usefull. We learning how to run a _shell_ command using **source**, we learned about **while** loops and **if** conditions in order to modify text in a determined file. 

Since we learned scripts this week, it is important to mention _"#!/bin/bash"_ which is used at the beginning of a script to indicate a path.

### Week 6

In _week 6_, we went through the basics of python and installing programmes, learning commands like **make** which is used to build other programms, as well as **apt and brew** which are used to install programs, we went through the **sudo** command which we will use greatly, the **pip** command which focuses specially on python programmes which we used to further develop linguistic analysis tools.

_"$ python3"_ is used to run python programs.

### Week 7

In _week 7_, we learned the basics of GitHub and creating a software, and we learned how to use and manage repositories, we used the **git** command which is used with all things related to Github, like **git pull** and **git push**

An essential command to know when using GitHub is _"git commit"_ which confirms the git process.

## Conclusions about the course

In conclusion, this course can be quite hard at the beginning for people like me who never learned how programming, but once you get used to it, it can become a smooth and filling experience. Furthermore, the content on moodle was very useful and helpful and has everything we needed in order to learn and pass the quizzes, although it could get stressful at times. Moreover, the teachers were very patient and helpful, as I had a lot of doubts and they helped me without any doubt, either in class or through the Slack forum. As a closing statement, it was a quite hard subject but the teaching method was very effective!
