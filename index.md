## Introduction

Hello everyone! My name is **Julen Beloqui** and I am from Spain, most precisely I live in the nothern Spanish region of the Basque Country, the coldest region in the country. I've always liked nature and cold since I grew with it, so Finland was a _no-brainer_ choice for me, I've always wanted to visit a Nordic country due to its distinct landscape and exceptional culture.

One of my favourite hobbies is walking on nature, notably I do this for approximately 2 hours in the days that I have enough time to do it. While I walk, I listen to music on my EarBuds, I am very conservative with my music taste, as I mostly stick to one genre. This year, my new favourite artist to listen to on my walks is Icelandic singer **Björk**, but recently I've been mostly listening to **Billie Eilish's** new album '_Hit Me Hard And Soft_'.
